Source file extensions:
	*.h + *.cpp   -- normal header + source
	*.hpp         -- part of source file conditionally #included into .cpp.

Indents:
	Tabs, not spaces. My tab size = 4.

Right margin:
	At the moment (1920x1080, QtCreator without right panel) ~190.

Identifiers:
	CamelCase for types and constants, lowCamelCase for everything else. Generally.

	Names ending with '_' usually denote something to be std::move()-d, be careful.

	Names containing '_' either identify something internal to their prefix (e.g. someFunc_Params means someFunc()'s parameter object),
	or maybe I just wanted visual grouping for faster eye-catching in IDE's Outline view.

	Name `path0` denotes result of realpath(3), e.g. "/usr/bin/su"; path1 == path0 + 1 (i.e. without leading slash, e.g. "usr/bin/su");
	it's to speed up Resolver checks collected paths against /var/lib/pacman/local/*/files entries which are realpaths without leading slash
	(see sources-pacman.txt).
	Exception is ldCache (parsed output of `ldconfig -p`): when working with it, `path1` is .so name without path (that deduplicates code in several places).
