Resolving libs
==============

Only one assumption was made here:


$ORIGIN
-------

Google says that $ORIGIN is resolved "relative to executable". This sounds like "..., not to library", but:

1. For example, most of /usr/lib/qtcreator/plugins/*.so have RPATH="$ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/../:$ORIGIN/../../Qt/lib",
   and `ldd` resolves their neededLibs as if $ORIGIN was library's contianing directory itself, not /usr/bin/qtcreator executable's
   containing directory /usr/bin: e.g. libStudioWelcome.so needs libCore.so (in the same dir), libUtils.so (in parent dir), etc.

2. If shared library is linked to executables located in different dirs, and its $ORIGIN resolved
   against those different dirs, then we'd need its multiple copies in memory, which is ridiculous.

So I assume that $ORIGIN is relative to library itself (meaning -- to it's containing directory, of course), not to what it's linked to.


Resolving symbols
=================

See `syms` git branch.
